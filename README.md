## Setting up

##### Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hack4impact/flask-base.git
$ cd flask-base
```

##### Initialize a virtualenv

```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

##### (If you're on a mac) Make sure xcode tools are installed

```
$ xcode-select --install
```

##### Add Environment Variables 

Create a file called `.env` that contains environment variables in the following syntax: `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=value`. For example,
the mailing environment variables can be set as the following. We recommend using Sendgrid for a mailing SMTP server. But anything else will work as well.
```
MAIL_USERNAME=SendgridUsername
MAIL_PASSWORD=SendgridPassword
SECRET_KEY=SuperRandomStringToBeUsedForEncryption
```
**Note: do not include the `.env` file in any commits. This should remain private.**

##### Install the dependencies

```
$ pip install -r requirements/common.txt
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

##### Other dependencies for running locally

You need to install [Foreman](https://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) and [Redis](http://redis.io/). Chances are, these commands will work:

```
$ gem install foreman
```

Mac (using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)):

```
$ brew install redis
```

Linux:

```
$ sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

##### Create the database

```
$ python manage.py recreate_db
```

##### Other setup (e.g. creating roles in database)

```
$ python manage.py setup_dev
```

Note that this will create an admin user with email and password specified by the `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` config variables. If not specified, they are both `flask-base-admin@example.com` and `password` respectively.

##### [Optional] Add fake data to the database

```
$ python manage.py add_fake_data
```

## Running the app

```
$ source env/bin/activate
$ foreman start -f Local
```
