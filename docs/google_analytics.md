# Adding Google Analytics

## Setup

Including Google analytics to your flask-base app is incredibly easy. Simply add an environment variable named `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` to a local file called `.env`.

A Google analytics ID can be obtained by signing up [here](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web). The ID should be of the form `UA-XXXXXX-X`.
