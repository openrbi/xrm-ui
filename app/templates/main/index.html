        <p>This is <a href="http://hack4impact.org">Hack4Impact</a>'s web application template. We'll use this as a
        foundation for each of our <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> projects. The goal is to reduce the work
        necessary to get a new project off the ground, by providing boilerplate code (such as account management
        facilities), as well as uncontroversial and extensible defaults. We have integrated an
        <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SCSS</a>-based asset pipeline based around a (fantastic!) framework
        called <a href="http://semantic-ui.com">Semantic UI</a>. Much of this code is appropriated from the examples
        in Miguel Grinberg's book, <a href="http://flaskbook.com"><em>Flask Web Development</em></a>.</p>

        <p>Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Congratulations, you played yourself. Hammock talk come soon. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.</p>
        <p>Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple.</p>
        <p>Cloth talk. Eliptical talk. Congratulations, you played yourself. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Bless up. Special cloth alert. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. To succeed you must believe. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Bless up. Congratulations, you played yourself. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.</p>
        <p>We don’t see them, we will never see them. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. Wraith talk. Another one. They don’t want us to eat. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. Cloth talk. It’s on you how you want to live our life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean.</p>
        <p>Give thanks to the most high. We the best. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. They don’t want us to win.
